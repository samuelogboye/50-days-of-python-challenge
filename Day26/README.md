# Day 26: Sort Words
Write a function called sort_words that takes a string of words
as an argument, removes the whitespaces, and returns a list of
letters sorted in alphabetical order. Letters will be separated by
commas. All letters should appear once in the list. This means
that you sort and remove duplicates. For example ‘love life’
should return as ['e,f,i,l,o,v'].

## Extra Challenge: Length of Words
s = 'Hi my name is Richard'
Write a function called string_length that takes a string of
words (words and spaces) as argument. This function should
return the length of all the words in the string. Return the results
in a form of a dictionary. The string above should return:
{'Hi': 2, 'my': 2, 'name': 4, 'is': 2, 'Richard': 7}
