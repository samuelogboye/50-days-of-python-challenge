# Day 38: Guess a Number

Write a function called guess_a_number. The function
should ask a user to guess a randomly generated number. If the
user guesses a higher number, the code should tell them that the
guess is too high, if the user guesses low, the code should tell
them that their guess is too low. The user should get a maximum
of three guesses. When the user guesses right, the code should
declare them a winner. After three wrong guesses, the code
should declare them a loser.

## Extra Challenge: Find Missing Numbers

list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 23, 14, 15, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31]
Write a function called missing_numbers that takes a list of
sequence of numbers and finds the missing numbers in the
sequence. The list above should return:
[4, 8, 10, 13, 16, 29, 30]
