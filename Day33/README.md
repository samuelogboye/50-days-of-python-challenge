# Day 33: List Intersection
Write a function called inter_section that takes two lists and
finds the intersection (the elements that are present in both
lists). The function should return a tuple of intersections. Use
list comprehension in your solution. Use the lists below. Your
function should return (30, 65, 80).
list1 = [20, 30, 60, 65, 75, 80, 85]
list2 = [ 42, 30, 80, 65, 68, 88, 95]


## Extra Challenge: Set or list
You want to implement a code that will search for a number in
a range. You have a decision to make as to whether to store the
number in a set or a list. Your decision will be based on time.
You have to pick a data type that executes faster.
You have a range and you can either store it in a set or a list
depending on which one executes faster when you are searching
for a number in the range. See below:
a = range(10000000)
x = set(a)
y = list(a)
Letâ€™s say you are looking for a number 9999999 in the range
above. Search for this number in the list and the set. Your
challenge is to find which code executes faster. You will pick the
one that executes quicker, lists, or sets. Run the two searches
and time them.
