# Day 30: Most Repeated Name
Write a function called repeated_name that finds the most
repeated name in the following list.
name = ["John", "Peter", "John", "Peter", "Jones", "Peter"]

## Extra Challenge: Sort by Last Name
You work for a local school in your area. The school has a list of
names of students saved in a list. The school has asked you to
write a program that takes a list of names and sorts them
alphabetically. The names should be sorted by last names. Here
is a list of names:
[‘Beyonce Knowles, ‘Alicia Keys’, ‘Katie Perry’, ‘Chris
Brown’,’ Tom Cruise’]
Your code should not just sort them alphabetically, but it should
also switch the names (the last name must be the first). Here is
how your code output should look:
['Brown Chris', 'Cruise Tom', 'Keys Alicia', 'Perry Katie',
'Knowles Beyonce']
Write a function called sorted_names.
