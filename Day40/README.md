# Day 40: Pig Latin
Write a function called translate that takes the following
words and translates them into pig Latin.
a = 'i love python'
Here are the rules:
1. If a word starts with a vowel (a,e, i, o, u) add ‘yay’ at the
end. For example, ‘eat’ will become ‘eatyay’
2. If a word starts with anything other than a vowel, move
the first letter to the end and add ‘ay’ to the end. For
example, ‘day’ will become ‘ayday’.
Your code should return:
iyay ovelay ythonpay
