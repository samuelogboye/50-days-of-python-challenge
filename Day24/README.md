# Day 24: Average Calories
Create a function called average_calories that calculates the
average calories intake of a user. The function should ask the user
to input their calories intake for any number of days and once they
hit ‘done’ it should calculate and return the average intake.

## Extra Challenge: Create a Nested List
Write a function called nested_lists that takes any number of
lists and creates a 2-dimensional nested list of lists. For example,
if you pass the following lists as arguments: [1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3,
4], [1, 3, 4, 5].
Your code should return: [[1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 4, 5]]
