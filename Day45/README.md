# Day 45: Words & Special Characters
Write a function called analyse_string that returns the number of
special characters (#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~), words,
and, total characters (all letters and special characters minus
whitespaces) in a string. Return everything in a dictionary format:
{“special character”: “number”, “words”: “number”, “total
characters”: “number”}
Use the string below as an argument:
“Python has a string format operator %. This functions
analogously to printf format strings in C, e.g. "spam=%s
eggs=%d" % ("blah", 2) evaluates to "spam=blah eggs=2".
