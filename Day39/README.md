# Day 39: Password Generator
Create a function called generate_password that generates any
length of password for the user. The password should have a
random mix of upper letters, lower letters, numbers, and
punctuation symbols. The function should ask the user how
strong they want the password to be. The user should pick from -
weak, strong, and very strong. If the user picks weak, the
function should generate a 5-character long password. If the user
picks strong, generate an 8-character password and if they pick
very strong, generate a 12-character password.
