# Day 37: Count the Vowels
Create a function called count_the_vowels. The function
takes one argument, a string, and returns the number of vowels
in the string. For example, ‘hello’ should return 2 vowels. If a
vowel appears in a string more than once it should be counted
as one. For example, ‘saas’ should return 1 vowel. Your code
should count lowercase and uppercase vowels.
