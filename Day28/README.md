# Day 28: Return Indexes
Write a function called index_position. This function takes a
string as a parameter and returns the positions or indexes of all
lower letters in the string. For example, ‘LovE’ should return
[1,2].

Write a function called largest_number that takes a list of
integers and re-arrange the individual digits to create the largest
number possible. For example, if you pass the following as an
argument: list1 = [3, 67, 87, 9, 2]. Your code should return the
number in this exact format: 9,877,632 as the largest number
