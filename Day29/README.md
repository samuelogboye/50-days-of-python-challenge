# Day 29: Middle Figure
Write a function called middle_figure that takes two
parameters a, and b. The two parameters are strings. The
function joins the two strings and finds the middle element.
If the combined string has a middle element, the function should
return the element, otherwise, return ‘no middle figure’. Use
‘make love’ as an argument for a and ‘not wars’ as an
argument for b. Your function should return ‘e’ as the middle
element. Whitespaces should be removed.
