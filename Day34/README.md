# Day 34: Just Digits
In this challenge, copy the text below and save it as a CSV file.
Save it in the same folder as your Python file. Save it as
python.csv.
Write a function called just_digits that reads the text from the
CSV file and returns only digit elements from the file. Your
function should return 1991, 2, 200, 3, 2008 as a list of
strings.

“Python was released in 1991 for the first time. Python 2 was
released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list
comprehensions and a cycle-detecting garbage collection system
(in addition to reference counting). Python 3 was released in 2008
and was a major revision of the language that is not
completely backward-compatible.”
